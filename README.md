##The idea and background:
The Phoenix is a mythological bird existing in the habits  and traditions of ancient people able to control fire and live again from its own ashes.
The comparison is regarded to actual time in which pandemic is impacting seriously various aspect of human life and a number of business sectors, accordingly!
Data:
One of these fields is the commercial aviation in which many airlines are suffering dramatically.
Before pandemic, in 2019, passengers that flew domestically and internationally worldwide were around 4 bilion!
This was a record data as this figure is  representing about the half of whole popolation of Earth! Spectacular outcome at that time, indeed!
Pandemic is impacting seriously on this industry so far.
AI techniques:
When this dramatic situation will be over there will be many challenges ahead to face because the entire pipeline of economic activities will be affected,
such as tourism and travel, hospitality, mobiliity related activities will boom again in total safety, whenwver an  important point of view will be generally assumed:
overall safety and good welfare of global population.
At this stage one must be ready to face the new normal accordingly. Many jobs have been lost and many others will  on one hand but, as a consequence, many others will spring out anew. In thes context AI will ease effecttively to achieve this goal. Digitilization increase in all sector amd major improvements in those activities related to air transportation. For instance let's think of security control, passport control, facila controll in certain airports where passengers will be flying from.
Challenges ahead: 
Improving airtraffic by considering also ecological impact on Earth and managing correctly the so called Environmental Sustainanability.
Here is the concept of the Phoenix again. To live again longer and better!
What next: 
Future generations will have to  face bigger troubles if some crucial knots are not solved as soon as possible!
